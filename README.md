- **Playwright**: A cross-browser automation library for Node.js. It enables you to write reliable end-to-end tests for web applications and websites. With Playwright, you can automate scenarios across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Allure**: A flexible, lightweight multi-language test report tool that provides a concise representation of test results in a neat web report form. It allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum useful information from everyday execution of tests.
